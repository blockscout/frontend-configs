    "description": "Subsquid Network is a decentralized data lake and query engine designed to provide developers with performant and permissionless access to on-chain data. The network is secured by ZK proofs, and has a modular architecture which enables unparalleled scalability and dev-friendliness for blockchain indexing, dApp development, and analytics. Subsquid is a response to unscalable and rigid monolithic indexing frameworks that had previously gained popularity and market traction among Web3 developers, but that are failing to stay ahead in a rapidly changing blockchain landscape. Furthermore, the network serves as a tremendously efficient decentralized alternative to centralized infrastructure companies, including large RPC and API providers.",
